the best ways that companies do this is by connecting and leveraging the 
managers of different departments. Work closely with Career Services to 
make sure that students know when you're on campus. Make your 
message clear and known. If you are looking for interns or have 
opportunities available, make it easy and award students to reach out to 
you. Make sure all types of communication paths are open and students 
can get information from you quickly.  </div></div>

important to check in with them as often as you can. Figure out which 
members of your team can supervise the interns. This person can be you 
or someone else on your team. The supervisor needs to be able to 
delegate tasks and mentor interns throughout the summer. <br><br>
